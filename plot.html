        The multiverse was never meant to intersect, but Ryuk, a bored Shinigami, used the Voidstone 
        to break the barriers between worlds. Now, dimensions are collapsing, and Void energy 
        corrupts everything it touches. Naruto, Nezuko, Levi, and Ichigo are pulled from their worlds 
        into a chaotic new reality. Together, they must stop Ryuk before he rewrites all existence 
        for his own amusement.

            <p>
              The multiverse was never meant to intersect, but Ryuk, a bored Shinigami, used the Voidstone to break the barriers
              between worlds. Now, dimensions are collapsing, and Void energy corrupts everything it touches. Naruto, Nezuko,
              Levi, and Ichigo are pulled from their worlds into a chaotic new reality. Together, they must stop Ryuk before he
              rewrites all existence for his own amusement.
            </p>
            <h3>The Journey:</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Naruto’s World:</b> The Hidden Leaf Village is overrun by Void monsters, forcing Naruto to face corrupted
              versions of his old foes.<br />
              <b>Nezuko’s World:</b> A tainted demon forest traps the group, testing their bonds as Nezuko fights her growing
              corruption.<br />
              <b>Levi’s World:</b> The team battles massive Void Titans, with Levi’s tactics critical for survival.<br />
              <b>Ichigo’s World:</b> The group confronts spiritual hollows fused with Void energy in a surreal dimension.
            </p>
            <h3>The Climax:</h3>
            <p>
              In the Void Citadel, Ryuk manipulates reality itself, forcing the team to overcome their fears and work together.
              Using Naruto’s leadership and the team’s synergy, they defeat Ryuk, sealing the Voidstone and restoring balance.
